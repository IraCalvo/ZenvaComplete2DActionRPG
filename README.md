# ZenvaComplete2DActionRPG

This game class puts all the RPGs together to create a big RPG game. This game solidified my knowledge on movement, collision, timers, and much more. This game features:
-WASD movement
-Inventory UI System
-RNG Loot System
-Tile Palettes
-Collisions
-Enemy AI to chase or shoot at the player
-Animations
-SFX
-Changing the player model based on the mouse position so it seems like it's looking at the mouse
-Ammo system
-Weapon rotation

Some of the things I learned is how to track the player's mouse within unity so that I can make a game do specific things based on where the mouse is. Additionally I
learned about scriptable objects so that I can make object based coding, and make it so that things inherit from one another.
